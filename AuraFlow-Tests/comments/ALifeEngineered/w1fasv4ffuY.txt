lost me at “a worker” sucks to live that life. build a business and work for yourself.

I love this question would love to have it asked to me

This guy definitely worked at Amazon 😂😂😂

I disagreed, explained my perspective, realised they were just concerned. Then did my best to address those concerns, stuck to what I believed, then got a poor performance review for the initial “disagreement” because apparently that meant I wasn’t a team player. Turns out I was right anyway. So confused as to what I did wrong…

What an awfully worded interview question. This is literally as effective as asking someone if they could be any pie, what kind of pie would they be… And then deducting points for choosing a cherry pie because cherries are red and red is the hostile scary color. 

It’s a concealed objective question. You have to guess what outcome they want and then wrap your answer to that. So, the only way to pass is by random luck which is a red flag if you pick this story, OR by knowing the question which is a red flag for cheating in an interview. Being deceptive is an instant hard pass from me. 

The question should elaborate further to include information about standing up for yourself or defending a difficult argument you felt was correct. Now you can evaluate candidates on a fair and non-randomized situation selection, and they can focus on the details that are actually relevant for this purpose.
