So having a wife = hack got it

160 seems low?

If the 300k isn't income tax, what is it coming from???

I think you do more to support the government in one year than Jeff bezos has in his whole life

What?! He didn't Pay any income tax but he paid 322 thousand?! I don't get it.

Only a couple hundred from YouTube? With almost 150k subs?

Love the transparency man tysm

Now if you're a business owner, you wouldn't have to pay uncle Sam so much of your earnings!!

Did you cash out those investment gains and paid capital gains tax?

Every principal engineer I know from faang claim they make over 1.2mil in salary+rsu.
Your numbers seem much more reasonable

Do similar video for 2023

Good for you but no one really cares lol

🥜🥜 for base

This one of the few times the thumbnail undersopd the content wow, 160k wasnt even CLOSE

He only made $289.48 on YouTube o_o;  Wow, mind blowing stats. I still have along way to go until I make $1 on YouTube. Thank you for sharing a realistic perspective and not some flashy object syndrome.

Clearly Uncle Sam is the winner here

I'm deeply moved by this material. A book I read with similar themes profoundly changed my outlook. "AWS Unleashed: Mastering Amazon Web Services for Software Engineers" by Various Authors

Your taxes is more than 7 of my generations total earned income 😂

👍👍

I am. An mba from indias premier. Insitute o wish to apply in Amazon can u be a reference

No income tax.. Good

You still have to pay federal income taxes just not state income taxes.

is that RSU vested or granted? Either way, amazing job 👏

bruh coz u got married u lost 300, 000 dollars?? i aint marrying

Operative word there was “we” :)  I make about the same as you (550k) for 9-5.  Do you defer any income?  Why or why not?

Can you help a laid off homie with wisdom on how to start a dev agency? My students are all principals now, I need to lvl up 😆 (not in code, I speak it all) but we all know startups is where it's at

I hope your wife is appreciative of your disproportunate inputs.  Otherwise beta males get left and looted.  It only takes one girls trip or for them to feel unhappy.

You paid uncle sam $322,474 in Taxes but then you said you don't have to pay income taxes. I don't get it,  need a little clarification here.

Your base as a principal eng is 160k?? Levels FYI begs to differ 🤔 I don’t get it

Your paying too much taxes.  Would you be interested in paying less?  Im a GP and I also make over a $1m a year.

way too dumb money in US tech :D Imagine getting paid that much. it is well above 5-20x as the absolutely highest paid jobs in any other country. Landing will not be soft. Good luck lads!

I wonder how long this video will be publicly available.

thanks for sharing this keep up with the honesty

Absolutely wicked loop. I see what you did there

Thanks for sharing this info! Even though you're not making much from Youtube, the small audience that you have benefits a lot from watching this.

Man, makes me want to jump into tech...
