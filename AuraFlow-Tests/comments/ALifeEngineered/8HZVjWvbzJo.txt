I have watched 2 episodes of Steve's video about outliers, and I am starting to feel this term is misused here. Steve seemed to use "outlier" to mean "outstanding" or "unusual" (in a good way).  But the 1st time I learned about this term was in my statistics classes, and it was supposed to refer to those values that should be "omitted" because they were "abnormally" and therefore couldn't be "representative". I'm not sure if its definition had evolved afterward.

The one who worked on their communication and collaboration skills believe it or not.

Alice is gonna get the job because DEI, women are winning in the IT arena.

So what would you recommend Alice, bob, and Charlie do to stand out? What are some dimensions that matter?

The one who got a referral

The person who will get a job first is the one who leetcodes ðŸ˜‚

how do you view becoming good in competitive programming??

1000% spot on. People have been spoiled by past years of employee demand into thinking they can go through the motions to stand out. I don't necessarily blame people, because breaking in is difficult,  but the most hireable people will always be people that go above and beyond to break the mold.

This makes a LOT of sense. Need become an outlier in one dimension that matters ....can that be explained more?

This is so discouraging not what you are saying but the content 
.  But I see so many people
Getting jobs in this market also though

Find a function vertical that has limited competition and large opportunity for process improvement. You have no idea how many businesses struggle to use Excel let alone touch code in their support offices

Wow, this channel is always spot on! Thanks Steve!
