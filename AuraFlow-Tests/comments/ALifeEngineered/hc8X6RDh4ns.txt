Happened to me, quit. Got re hired in another country by the same company. Now im getting the same salary as my manager gets ðŸ˜‚

What are your thoughts if your manager is supportive of your promotion but there's not enough budget for another year.

Many of us are our own worst managers, too. An opportunity presents itself and we're too afraid to press that one button to apply.

Thanks Uncle Steve!
