While he is right with Java if we are honest, as it's ubiquitous in the corporate world.. I would say it's very unlikely to find a job as a Java developer WITHOUT years and years of experience. Because for Java Jobs, you Will compete with ..Java devs who have years and years of experience... üòê

Well say üëçüëç

Learn C# because it's a good language but its not fashionable so no one wants to learn it, which means you're not competing with the world and his dog if you try to go for a job that uses it, and it is more realistic for you to be in the top 10 -20% of best candidates if you step up your game.

I'd say pick two languages that will force you to learn proper OOP and proper FP. I'd say that's C# and F#. After you know them well you can go deep with learning how computers work with C, Zig, C++, and more, as time allows it. At least you know two programming languages very well that will make you a very good practitioner and have a job while you learn more.

Go :0

"Learn Python if you want to get into AI" 

"Learn Python" <-- FIFY

Thank you! ‚ù§

horrible advice.

Well learning C takes like 20 years to get good at, so good luck people!

I recommend BASIC, pascal, Cobol and Fortran.   Much more relevant if you want to travel back to 1986.

golang > java

Java??? Naw dawg. It‚Äôs Rust. And not JavaScript it‚Äôs Typescript.

Avoid Java/.Net

C++???
Lolz

As a Sr SWE, the most important language that‚Äôs often overlooked is English. Clearly articulating thoughts with the correct context is both harder and more useful than any programming language

c# or c++ ?

Golang should've been mentioned imo. It's more beginner friendly than java and many companies already use it/are starting to use it

C++ ?
